      <h1>The DreamCraft Research</h1>
      <p>Drawing upon groundbreaking neurological research conducted in collaboration with leading experts, DreamCraft has uncovered key insights into the intricate workings of the dreaming mind. By studying the brain's patterns during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, a state closely associated with vivid dreaming, DreamCraft's researchers have identified neural signatures and activity indicative of impending dream content. <br> <br> <br>

        Through the development of our headset, DreamCraft leverages this research to manipulate dreams. The headset utilizes advanced neurofeedback technology to monitor the user's brain activity in real-time during sleep. By detecting the specific neural patterns associated with different dream states, DreamSense is able to introduce subtle audio-visual cues that seamlessly integrate with the dream narrative.</p>
